uDoc-UDX-Utility
================

The UDX utility works with files written in uDoc, a documentation markup language.  It converts losslessly between the minimized and fully-tagged forms of uDoc.  The minimized form is better for authoring, proofreading, and editing.  The fully-tagged form is better for XSLT processing.
