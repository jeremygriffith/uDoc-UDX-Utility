uDoc UDX Utility
================

The udx utility works with files written in uDoc, a documentation markup language.  It converts losslessly between the minimized and fully-tagged forms of uDoc.  The minimized form is better for authoring, proofreading, and editing.  The fully-tagged form is better for XSLT processing. The udx utility is in C++ and is FOSS under the Apache 2.0 license.

We want to thank John Cowan for his very helpful critique of the uDoc markup language itself, and for urging us to create this utility to enable easy use of uDoc files by existing XML tools such as XSLT.

The current documentation, in OmniHelp, is in udxutil_omnihelp.zip; unzip it in its own directory, and double-click \_udxutil.htm.
